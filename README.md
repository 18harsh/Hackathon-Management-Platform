# Built a hackathon management platform for ensuring smooth communication between organizing teams and participating teams. 


# Problem Statement

This year’s Unscript Hackathon took its registrations through Devfolio and the whole one-on-one communication with the teams was done through Gmail. All the teams are hosted on our Discord server currently and any form of formal communication with the teams  through the hackathon is done through Google Meet. Any sort of complaints are dealt with through Discord team channels and the final submissions would be reviewed through each team’s Github repository links. Sounds too complicated, right? This looks like a problem waiting to be solved. The goal of this problem statement is to create a one-stop seamless platform to host all activities required to organize a successful hackathon. API integrations can also be made use of. 

For this problem statement, we strongly encourage you to rack your brains and include any creative features that you feel will set your product apart.



# The problem Hack Dev solves

We were able to integrate a Github-based Authentication System.

Manage and Control all the hackathon-related data on a firebase in real-time.

Any User can organize the hackathon.

Integrate A Chat room per Hackathon and Video and Audio Calling Session.

An Individual Team can upload their project on the platform.

The Organiser can also view the project and its GitHub stats respectively.
